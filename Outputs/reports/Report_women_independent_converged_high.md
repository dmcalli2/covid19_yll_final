# Years of Life Lost for women assuming age and comorbidity are independent. The correlation between comorbidities was modelled and the model did/was converged .

This document combines the comorbidity, age and survival model outputs
to estimate years of life lost. It can be rendered for men and women,
and assuming that age and comorbidity are associated or independent.
This particular report is for women and assumes that age and comorbidity
are independent.

It also allows for sensitivity analyses on the correlation between
comorbidities. This analysis is

The mean age for the ISS deaths was 81.1 overall and 81.5 when people
who died aged &lt;50 were excluded from the calculation.

The estimated years of life lost obtained by applying the age
distributions from the ISS report to these tables was 12.2 per person
using the whole cohort and 11.8 after excluding those aged under 50.

# Combining samples from survival models, age models and comorbidity models

The following combines 10,000 samples from survival models, age models
and comorbidity models to estimate the age, sex and comorbidity specific
life expectancy and subsequently years of life lost.

## Age distributions

The following shows the modelled age-distribution of the ISS data (based
on the published counts of patients in each age band). The grey bars are
for the simulated data and the coloured bars are the original data
(assuming a uniform distribution within each age-band).

The following is a check that the names of the comorbidities are the
same in the samples from the survival models and comorbidity estimates.

coefficients and variance-covariance matrix from the survival model
shoudl be identical apart from the shape and rate parameters.

## Estimating the linear predictor for each of the 10,000 iterations

Note that these multiplications are not matrix multiplications. They are
element-wise multiplications of identically positioned elements in each
matrix. Each part of the linear predictor is calculated separately,
these are then summed to obtain the linear predictor based on the age
and comorbidity distributions of the simulated patients.

``` r
## shape parameter
shpe       <- surv_smpls[ , "shape"]

## Intercept (rate parameter)
cept_lp    <- surv_smpls[ , "rate"]
```

The following shows the linear predictor for covariates without
interactions by age. These are mostly positive, reflecting the fact that
almost all of the comorbidites are associated with increased hazard
rates for death.

``` r
## This multiplies the covariate level (binary) with the simulated coefficeints
non_age_lp <- italy[,name_cols] * (surv_smpls[, name_cols])
## This adds these together to get the non-age dependent part of the linear predictor
non_age_lp <- rowSums(non_age_lp)
hist(non_age_lp, breaks = 100)
```

The following shows the linear predictor for covariates with
interactions by age. All are negative, reflecting the fact that there is
attenuation in the hazard ratios for the comorbid diseases with
increasing age, as is common in chronic disease epidemiology.

# ensure_matrices_match

## Estimate the survival at each time-point (3-monthly)

The following uses a function from the flexsurv package called by
summary.flexsurv to obtain survival probabilities at each follow-up
time. Where the time is before the patients age at baseline (in this
case the age at death in the ISS data) the survival probability is by
definition one.

In this function all notional patients have the same shape parameter,
but have patient-specific rate parameters. This function is not
vectorised with respect to the rate and shape parameters, but it is
nonetheless very fast.

For one simulated patient in the âlowâ SD age group the rate and age
variables are such that the function returns a missing value, this is
the only sample that does so. Presumably there is a numerical reason in
the internals of the function. Give a warning and drop from the summary
function at the end. Return an error if there is more than one missing.
Only occured in most recent set of simulated patients which is a fresh
simulation.

``` r
times_vect <- seq(50, 150, 0.25)
tot_surv <- matrix(NA, nrow = 10000, ncol = length(times_vect))
for(i in 1:10000){
  a <- SurvGomp(t = times_vect, start = age_smpls[i], shape = shpe[i], rate = tot_rat[i],
                lower_tail = TRUE, give_log = FALSE)
  tot_surv[i,] <- t(a)
}

tot_surv_na <- matrix(is.na(tot_surv), nrow = 10000, ncol = length(times_vect))
tot_surv_na <- rowSums(tot_surv_na)
tot_surv_na <- any(tot_surv_na >=1)
tot_surv_na <- sum(tot_surv_na)

The following corrects for the fact that the intercept-only life
expectancy from the models in Wales are slightly lower than those in the
WHO GBD life-expectancy tables. The Wales life expectancies are
multiplied by between 1.07 and 1.02 depending on the age.

## Years of life lost

The following calculates the years of life lost from the age, sex and
comorbidity defined survival and the age and comorbidities at death from
the ISS data.

``` r
yll <- le - age_smpls
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(age_smpls, yll, xlab = "Age (years)", ylab = "Years of life lost")
hist(yll, breaks = 50, xlab = "Years of life lost", ylab = "Number of simulated patients")

## Compare YLL using WHO tables and comorbidity-based assesment

Among those over 50 for which both methods were used, the WHO tables
based estimates of YLL, and our estimates which additionally accomodate
comorbidity, yielded similar per capita YLL; the values were 11.8 and
9.16 respectively.

## YLL by age and comorbidity

The following shows the distribution of YLL by age, sex and comorbidity
by age categories.

### Table YLL per capita by comorbidity count, and age

``` r
yll_df <- tibble(yll = yll) %>% 
  mutate(comorbidity_count = factor(italy_count, ordered = TRUE),
         age = round(age_smpls),
         age_cat = Hmisc::cut2(age, cuts = seq(50, 80, 10)))

yll_smry <- yll_df %>% 
  group_by(comorbidity_count, age_cat) %>% 
  summarise(yll = mean(yll) %>% round(2)) %>% 
  rename(`Comorbidity count` = comorbidity_count) %>% 
  spread(age_cat, yll)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'comorbidity_count' (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
knitr::kable(yll_smry)
```

## Plot distribution of years of life lost by age and comrobidity count

Plot distributions of YLL overall, then stratified by age, with colour
indicating the comorbidity count.

``` r
plot1_yll <- ggplot(yll_df, aes(x = yll,  fill = comorbidity_count)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  scale_y_continuous("Number of simulated patients") +
  scale_x_continuous("Years of life lost")

## Crude approach to obtain 95% credible interval

The following approach uses empirical bootstrapping to calculate an
uncertainty interval around the mean YLL. This

``` r
res <- map_dbl(1:1000, ~  mean(sample(yll, 404, replace = TRUE)))
hist(res, xlab = "Mean Years of Life Lost")
```

![](Report_women_independent_converged_high_files/figure-gfm/credible%20intervals-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
est <- mean(res, na.rm = TRUE) %>% round(1)
lci_uci <- quantile(res, probs = c(0.025, 0.975), na.rm = TRUE) %>% round(1) %>% paste(collapse = "-")
est
```

    ## [1] 9.2

``` r
lci_uci
```

    ## [1] "8.6-9.7"

The mean and (95% credible interval) for the years of life lost using
this approach was 9.2 (95% CI 8.6-9.7).

``` r
mylist <- list(est, lci_uci, mean_age_restricted, mean_age_whole,
               plot_ages1, plot_ages2, plot_ages3, plot_surv, plot1_yll, plot2_yll,
               who, yll_df, yll_mean_who_restricted, yll_mean_who_whole, yll_smry)
saveRDS(mylist, paste0("Output_rmd/",
